# python-challenge

(PyBank)

For this challenge I created a Python script that analyzes the records in the budget_data.csv file to calculate each of the following:


  - The total number of months included in the dataset.


  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.


  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, as well as the average of those changes.


  - The greatest increase in profits over the entire period, including the date and the amount.


   - The greatest decrease in losses over the entire period, including the date and the amount.
