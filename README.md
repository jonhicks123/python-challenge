# python-challenge

(PyBank)

For this challenge I created a Python script that analyzes the records in the budget_data.csv file to calculate each of the following:


  - The total number of months included in the dataset.


  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.


  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, as well as the average of those changes.


  - The greatest increase in profits over the entire period, including the date and the amount.


   - The greatest decrease in losses over the entire period, including the date and the amount.

(PyPoll)

As for this challenge, I created a Python script that analyzes the votes, county, and candidates in the election_data.csv to calculate each of the following:


  - The total number of votes that were cast.


  - The percentage of votes that each candidate won.


  - The total number of votes each candidate won (within the same line as the percentage).


  - The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
For both challenges, their scripts print the results into the terminal, as well as a separate .txt file which are placed into the analysis folder in the directory of each challenge.

To run the script and yield the results:
 
 
  - Download the repository and extract the python-challenge zip to the location of your choice
  
  
  - Open up Visual Studio Code or Spyder and cd into the directory where you extracted this repository.
  
  
  - For PyBank, cd into python-challenge, then cd into PyBank directory. For PyPoll, cd into python-challenge, then cd into PyPoll directory.
